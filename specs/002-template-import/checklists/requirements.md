# Specification Quality Checklist: Template Import from ZIP File

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 19, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - Specification contains no implementation details (no mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or technologies)
✅ **PASS** - Content focuses on user value (importing templates to save time, clear error feedback, visual progress)
✅ **PASS** - Written in plain language suitable for non-technical stakeholders
✅ **PASS** - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are specific
✅ **PASS** - All functional requirements are testable (e.g., "button positioned to the left", "modal opens", "validates ZIP file")
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria include specific metrics (under 10 seconds, 95% success rate, 100% error feedback)
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (describe user experience and outcomes, not technical implementation)
✅ **PASS** - Each user story has detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
✅ **PASS** - Edge cases are identified (multiple HTML files, unsupported formats, nested folders, concurrent imports, etc.)
✅ **PASS** - Scope is clearly bounded to ZIP import functionality with index.html and images
✅ **PASS** - Key assumptions documented in edge cases (file structure expectations, supported formats)

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
✅ **PASS** - User scenarios cover complete flow: discovery (seeing button) → action (clicking, uploading) → validation → success/error feedback
✅ **PASS** - Success criteria provide measurable outcomes for feature validation
✅ **PASS** - Specification maintains focus on "what" and "why" without prescribing "how"

## Notes

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive edge case coverage addresses common ZIP structure variations
- Clear prioritization of user stories enables incremental implementation
- Specific success criteria provide clear acceptance targets
- Functional requirements are granular enough to be individually testable

**Recommendations**:
- During planning phase, consider file storage strategy assumptions (local vs cloud storage)
- Plan for accessibility compliance in the import modal (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- Consider rate limiting for import operations during implementation planning
