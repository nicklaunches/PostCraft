# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Studio Dashboard

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 18, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on WHAT and WHY without specifying HOW:
- No mention of specific frameworks beyond react-email-editor (which is a user requirement)
- Describes user needs and business value
- Uses plain language accessible to stakeholders
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASS** - All requirements are complete and unambiguous:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 25 functional requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "System MUST serve the local studio dashboard on localhost:3579")
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "within 2 seconds", "90% of the time", "100+ templates")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic and measurable
- All 7 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- 10 edge cases are identified with clear handling expectations
- Scope is bounded to local studio dashboard functionality
- Assumptions section clearly documents 10 key assumptions

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASS** - Feature is ready for planning:
- Each functional requirement maps to user scenarios and success criteria
- User scenarios progress logically from P1 (access) → P2 (CRUD) → P3 (advanced features)
- 12 measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

The specification is **READY FOR PLANNING** with `/speckit.plan`. All quality criteria have been met:

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive user scenarios with 7 prioritized stories covering all aspects of the feature
- Clear prioritization rationale explaining why each story has its priority level
- Well-defined edge cases anticipating real-world usage scenarios
- Strong success criteria with specific, measurable outcomes
- Proper shadcn/ui and accessibility requirements integrated throughout
- Variable management feature properly scoped with examples

**Next Steps:**
- Proceed to `/speckit.clarify` if any stakeholder questions arise
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the technical implementation plan
