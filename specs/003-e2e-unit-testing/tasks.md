# Tasks: E2E Testing and Unit Testing Implementation

**Feature Branch**: `003-e2e-unit-testing`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-e2e-unit-testing/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

**Tests**: This feature implements the testing infrastructure itself. Test tasks are included to demonstrate the testing patterns after infrastructure is set up.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story (P1-P3) to enable independent implementation and testing of each capability.

**Total Tasks**: 65 (T001-T064 + T008a for schema drift detection)

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4, US5)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- Project root: `/Users/sitemax/Projects/postcraft.dev/PostCraft/`
- Tests: `tests/` at repository root
- Configs: `vitest.config.ts`, `playwright.config.ts` at root
- Existing code: `lib/`, `app/`, `components/`

---

- [x] T007 Implement tests/db-setup.ts with setupTestDatabase(), resetDatabase() using transaction rollback strategy for parallel execution, seedFixtures(), cleanup() functions
- [x] T008 Implement tests/setup.ts with global test setup, Vitest globals import, database migration runner, environment validation
- [x] T008a Implement schema drift detection in tests/setup.ts verifying applied migrations match migration files, failing fast with clear error if mismatch detected
- [x] T009 [P] Create tests/mocks/unlayer.ts with createUnlayerMock() factory implementing MockUnlayerAPI interface
- [x] T010 [P] Create tests/mocks/fixtures/sample-template.json with valid Unlayer design JSON

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all test implementation
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - US1 (Unit Tests): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US2 (E2E Tests): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US3 (API Tests): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US4 (Integration Tests): Can start immediately after Foundational
  - US5 (Coverage): Can start immediately after Foundational (but benefits from other tests existing)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Unit Tests)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **User Story 2 (P1 - E2E Tests)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **User Story 3 (P2 - API Tests)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **User Story 4 (P2 - Integration Tests)**: Independent - can start after Foundational
- **User Story 5 (P3 - Coverage)**: Independent - can start after Foundational (most valuable when other tests exist)

### Within Each User Story

**US1 (Unit Tests)**:
- All test file creation tasks (T013-T016) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks (T017-T019) run after test files created

**US2 (E2E Tests)**:
- Fixture creation (T020) can run in parallel with test files
- All test spec creation (T021-T025) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification/configuration tasks (T026-T029) run after test files created

**US3 (API Tests)**:
- Fixture creation (T030) can run in parallel with test files
- All API test creation (T031-T035) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks (T036-T037) run after test files created

**US4 (Integration Tests)**:
- All test file creation tasks (T038-T043) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks (T044-T046) run after test files created

**US5 (Coverage)**:
- All verification tasks (T047-T054) can run in any order

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- Documentation tasks (T055-T059) can run in parallel [P]
- Verification tasks (T060-T064) run after documentation complete

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All 4 tasks can run in parallel if coordinated

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**:
- Config files (T005, T006) in parallel
- Setup utilities (T007, T008) in parallel
- Mock utilities (T009-T011) in parallel
- npm scripts (T012) independent

**Phase 3-7 (User Stories)**:
- **ALL user stories can be worked on in parallel** by different team members after Phase 2 completes
- Within each story, tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

**Phase 8 (Polish)**:
- All documentation tasks in parallel
- Verification tasks sequential
